Feature setup code generation
====
Once the plugin has enough features across enough C files, setting up and
tearing down everything will get kind of annoying. That's where some more code
generation might be nice.

There's a few vague ideas of how to do this but really it's pretty open-ended
overall. In the meantime, we're just calling functions manually. Not a huge
deal, really.
