These are imported 3rd party library sources, wrangled for ease of plonking into
the build (e.g. relative #includes, etc.).

Used in SST itself:
  [none currently, stuff will probably be added later]

Used in debug builds, but not compiled into releases:
  - udis86

Used at build time:
  - chibicc (somewhat hacked up for use as a lexer)
  - asprintf() from OpenBSD (for compatibility on Windows)

Most of the C sources have wrappers in the parent directory to build proper
objects for use in the project, and wrapper headers to get the full APIs as
conveniently as possible. In other words, most of these files aren't built or
used directly.

It is possible that these libraries may end up lightly modified; we err on the
side of changing things to fit our use case rather than working around problems
in outer layers. A couple of the libraries are pretty old and don't see much
upstream change, but are small enough to be comfortably maintained as vendored.

IMPORTANT! Libraries are distributed subject to their copyright notices; please
refer to those!
