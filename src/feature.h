 * Declares that this translation unit implements a "feature" - a unit of plugin
 * functionality.
 *
 * At build time, the code generator automatically creates the glue code
 * required to make features load and unload in the correct order, subject to
 * compatibility with each supported game and engine version. As such, there is
 * no need to manually plug a new feature into SST's initialisation code as long
 * as dependency information is properly declared (see the macros below).
 *
 * desc specifies a string to be displayed to the user in the console printout
 * that gets displayed when the plugin finishes loading. Omit this to declare an
 * internal feature, which won't be displayed to users but will still be
 * available for other features to call into and build functionality on top of.

 * Declares that this feature should only be loaded for games matching the given

 *
 * As an optimisation, REQUIRE_GAMEDATA() checks (see below) can also be elided
 * in cases where gamedata is always present for this particular game. As such,
 * it is wise to still specify gamedata dependencies correctly, so that the
 * definitions can be changed in the data files without breaking code.

 * Note that this really only works for variables known to engineapi.c which is

 * Defines the special feature initialisation function which is unique to this

 * The defined function must return FEAT_OK on success, FEAT_FAIL on failure due

 * current game/engine version, or FEAT_SKIP to indicate that the feature is
 * useless or unnecessary.

 * later and other features that depend on this feature will be disabled. If
 * this feature provides other functions as API, they can be assumed not to get
 * called unless initialisation is successful.
 *

 * the exception of FEAT_SKIP will cause a corresponding status message to be
 * displayed in the listing after the plugin finishes loading, while FEAT_SKIP
 * will simply hide the feature from the listing. Features with no description

 * Defines a special feature pre-init function which performs early feature
 * initialisation, the moment the plugin is loaded. If the plugin is autoloaded
 * via VDF, this will be called long before the deferred initialisation that
 * usually happens after the client and VGUI have spun up. Since most of the
 * rest of SST is also deferred, care must be taken not to call anything else
 * that is not yet initialised.
 *
 * When in doubt, do not use this; it exists only to serve a couple of fringe
 * cases.
 *
 * Like INIT above, the function created by this macro is expected to return one
 * of FEAT_OK, FEAT_FAIL, FEAT_INCOMPAT, or FEAT_SKIP. If a value other than
 * FEAT_OK is returned, the INIT block won't be run afterwards.
 *
 * Features that use this macro are currently disallowed from using REQUIRE()
 * and REQUEST(), as well as GAMESPECIFIC(), because it's not clear how the
 * semantics of doing so should work. It is still possible to use
 * REQUIRE_GAMEDATA and REQUIRE_GLOBAL, however these only apply to the INIT
 * block, *NOT* the PREINIT.
